MrGadget uses the JSch library, and was built for use in Gradle, but is a self-contained set of Groovy classes that should be useful anywhere. It is designed to do 4 things: 1) send a file to a remote server via SCP, 2) send a file to a remote server via SFTP, 3) execute a command on a remote server, 4) execute a SUDO command on a remote server.

MrGadget will use the System.console to prompt the user for necessary passwords, and there is an option to save these passwords, using encryption, in the system preferences. The encryption scheme is better than plain text, but rather basic, and as this is open-source, NO GUARANTEE is made regarding the security of the encryption. It is certainly better than saving the passwords in plain text in a config file or build file, but an interested person could reverse engineer the key used and discover the password. SO USE THIS FEATURE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
